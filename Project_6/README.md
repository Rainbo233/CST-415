Hello Professor!

This is my q-learning project for CST-415.

The engine I used to make this maze was the Godot Engine,
which is very similar to unity in terms of design.

The way that it works as explained in the video is that
for each episode the blue square tries and find the 
exit, it is given a score on how well it performed.

When it gets a success, it will learn from that and begin to 
zero in on the correct path, storing its score in an array each time.

The video shows the scores displaying at the end, as I assume you
do not have Godot installed on your computer.

I have also attatched two executable files for the project,
one for Windows and another for Linux, whichever you prefer.
To run them, all you need to do is extract the file onto
the desktop and run it, or enter it on the command line when
going to the folder you extracted it to.

Do note that you will not get the output terminal as shown
in the video, for that you will need the Godot Engine as it
uses it's output terminal to do. But the video shows it
working just fine so that part is unneccessary.
