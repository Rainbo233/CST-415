Hello Professor,

The scripts for the project will be located in the Scripts folder.
There's only one script in the project, which you can find a backup
file for in the Zip file attatched to the project submission.

I wanted to attatch an executable file for you to try as well, but
for some reason the export is bugging out and I cannot add it to the github.

The way that the program works is that you mouse over one of the colored squares,
and it displays the forward and backward probabilities for each color,
including itself. In the background are 4 hidden observations that are taken into account,
which modify the backwards probability for each state.
